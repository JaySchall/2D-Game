Hey, here are some tasks and use cases that may be nice to be on the same page regarding changes made, where we are in development etc ...

1. Game Basics

Top down 2D movement for the player character using arrow keys or W A S D

Add Animation for movement in each direction

Win and Lose Conditions:
I think someone has some of these done, feel free to make changes anywhere - thanks

Win: Reach goal/exit for the level after powering necessary objects.

Lose: Player loses after player and enemy make contact (or we could do hp system). 

Player runs out of time (if we want a timer based system, personally I am not a big fan of this lose condition)

2. Powering Mechanics

Electrical Cord:

Visual representation of cord, it should be easy to know when you are holding cord or not

Visible prompt when near power socket or device that is interactable

Player must disconnect from one object before connecting to another


Objects to Power:

Lights - Provide light (duh)

Doors - Some doors could be locked and need power to open

Traps: Potentially traps to hinder enemies or help player progress?  Could require power

Enemy distractions/weapons: Power certain objects could give a strategic advantage against enemies - could implement a risk/reward type system maybe

Moving Platforms: Platforms or Elevators that move when powered 


Power Management Puzzles:

Design puzzles where player must decide which objects to power first to complete the level

Ensure the player cant get softlocked - have it so player can always retrieve cord after using it, so they dont trap themselves (or if we want the player to be able to trap themselves, a fast restart option)

3. Enemies

Basic Patrol Enemy: Moves in a set pattern or line, if player gets too close - they are noticed and chased

Ranged Enemy: Similar to patrol enemy, but has ranged attacks and slightly better vision

More to come i'm sure

4. User Interface and Menu

Main Menu: 

Start Game: Loads first level or demo level, could implement level selection

Exit: Closes game

5. Audio and Effects (if possible)

Ambient sounds

Buzzing when near electrical devices

Audio cues for enemy alert 

6. Testing and Development

Frequently playtest and pull, be sure to let other know when you are working on technical game features - we are all pushing to MAIN lol

Gather feedback

more to come
